<p class="cap">This lecture was read to
Oxford University Extension
Students, in the Sheldonian
Theatre, in August, 1917. The
general subject of the lectures and
classes was “The Near Future:
problems of construction and reconstruction.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Master of University College,
who presided over the meeting,
pointed out that I had said nothing
of the help which is given to young
men by their sisters. He spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of the legions of young men who
“keep straight” because they keep
in mind what their sisters are to
them. I ought to have said something
of this influence of home-life.</p>

<p>And I ought, perhaps, to have
defined with more exactness the
very words which I would use, if
it were my duty to attempt a boy’s
“sex-education”—we could hardly
find an uglier title for it. But I
was afraid to say more than I did
say. The great thing is, that the
parent, or it may be the teacher,
should be able to tell the child,
“Do come to me, right away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
whenever you are puzzled or
shocked at anything that you read,
or hear, or notice: and I will tell
you, as well as I can, all that you
need to know about it.” And the
greatest thing of all is careful self-preparation.
To answer a child
with evasive or lying nonsense is
to offend the child: and we have
it on good authority that we deserve
for that offence the millstone
round our necks, and the depth of
the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Adolescence">ADOLESCENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="cap">The honour of coming here
was embittered by the difficulty
of deciding what to say and
how to say it. One of the hardest
of all subjects, adolescence, was
given to me: with this added hardship,
that I was to consider it as
something which may be reconstructed
in the near future; or as
a problem which we may somehow
solve. It needs more than a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
to understand adolescence: it needs,
at the very least, a Royal Commission.
I do not understand, really
understand, anybody except myself;
indeed, I do not thoroughly understand
even me. One thing, to begin
with, I did know about adolescence.
I knew that it was a Latin word.
So I looked it up in the Latin dictionary.
And there I found to my
surprise that the ancients were not
agreed as to the term of adolescence.
Varro reckons it from the
15th to the 30th year of life. Cicero
speaks of Crassus, at 34, as adolescent:
he even uses the word of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Brutus and Cassius, when they
were 40; and, what is most unexpected
of all, he uses it of himself,
in the year of his Consulship,
when he was 44. Nothing could
be more incorrigibly middle-aged
than Cicero at 44; nothing could
be more finally settled beyond all
possibility of unsettlement. We
cannot discuss adolescence, if it is
to include persons of that standing.</p>

<p>Shall we therefore put this word
back in the Latin dictionary, and
speak not of adolescence but of
youth? But the word youth hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
takes into account the bodily
changes which occur between
childhood and adult life. We are
concerned here with the schoolroom
years, the threshold years,
say, from 14 to 18. All of us,
when we think seriously about boys
and girls from 14 to 18 years old,
have at the back of our minds the
thought of sex. And you must
forgive me, if I use very plain
words this evening: for I hope and
believe that you will prefer, from
a man of my profession, plain
speaking to roundabout phrases.</p>

<p>My theme is adolescence: I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
no right to talk about small children.
But how can I help myself?
Boys and girls begin to be vaguely
conscious of sex, long before they
are 14; some of them get into
unclean habits, or say unclean
things, when they are nearer to 4
than they are to 14; indeed, they
may get into unclean habits before
they are 4. If we are to understand
the schoolroom, we must first
understand the nursery. Children,
by the time that they are 14, are
what those 14 years have made
them, with our assistance, or with
our neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>But, as all of us are well aware,
no two children are exactly alike
in this matter. The differences
between them are finely graduated;
but the extremes of difference are
miles apart. Some children are
wholly incurious about sex; some
are slightly inquisitive, some are
very inquisitive, and some, but
very few, not one in a thousand,
are downright vicious and obsessed.</p>

<p>We are too ready, it may be, to
give all our praise to those who
are wholly incurious; we call them
healthy-minded, pure-minded, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
so forth. We admire them because
they take no interest in this
part of their natural life, just as
we admire them because they
take no interest in the working of
their brains and their digestive
organs. But there is nothing very
admirable in this blank indifference
toward the affairs of the body; it
is good common sense, but we
ought to think twice before we
regard it as a virtue: it is altogether
negative, and virtues are
something positive. We can safely
afford to keep some of our admiration
for the children who are inquisitive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Besides, we have no
business to put the possession of
sex on a level with the possession
of digestive organs. The facts of
digestion are merely physiological:
you can take them or leave them.
The facts of sex are not merely
physiological: and it is perilous,
either to take them or to leave
them.</p>

<p>Of course, the incurious child is
more easy to talk to, more easy
to get on with, than the inquisitive
child; but we can hardly wish all
boys and girls from 14 to 18 to
remain thus childish in their knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
of themselves. I do not believe
that what we call “innocence”
is any sure protection to boys or to
girls against impure or perverted
ways in adolescence. Indeed, I
am inclined to believe that innocence,
or ignorance, may even
betray them instead of protecting
them.</p>

<p>Besides, it is the accepted way
of intelligent children to be inquisitive:
it is their birthright to ask us
any amount of questions. A child
who never asks a question about
sex is indeed, so far as that goes,
a backward child: what we call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
unobservant. In some ways, this
non-questioning mind is good for
young children; but surely it is
unnatural that the children should
attain to adolescence and still be
ignorant of what they are.</p>

<p>Whether these incurious children
tend to be passionless in early adult
life, I do not know; nor can I make
any guess as to the proportion,
in adolescence, of temperaments
devoid of passion. Only, if they
who are incurious during childhood
do tend to be passionless in later
years, that is no reason why we
should admire them as children.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
For, in the design of our nature,
and in the fabric of our nature,
there is a place, and a very honourable
place, for passion held under
control. And they who have nothing
to control are to be congratulated,
because they are out of the
way of temptation; but we admire,
even more, those who are in the
way of temptation and withstand
it.</p>

<p>If this be true, or anywhere near
true, that a measure of inquisitiveness
in childhood, and a measure
of passion in early adult life, are
welcome signs of a sane mind in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
sane body, such as Juvenal bids us
pray for, then it follows that we
ought to give careful regard to
these inquisitive children, and wise
and honest answers to their embarrassing
questions.</p>

<p>But we grown-up folk are not
agreed, nor ever shall be, what to
tell them, and when to tell it. We
have no set method of talking to
children about sex, nor of warning
older boys and girls against the
miseries into which it may, if they
let it, bring them. Of course, this
want of agreement is not altogether
our fault; we are so divided, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the children are so diverse.
Their differences of temperament
are reflected in our different ways
of dealing with them. The fact
remains, that we have no common
plan, no authorised programme:
and, if ever we do invent one,
which we never shall, it will not
suit all the children. Each of us,
in this perplexity, judges for himself
or herself; there is nothing
else to be done.</p>

<p>Still, we can be agreed over
some points; we can make one or
two rules, and keep them before
us. It is a good rule, surely, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
we should prepare ourselves and
arm ourselves against the shock
of a sudden question. We must
have our answers ready. We must
rehearse, we must learn almost
word for word, as it were by heart,
what we will say, when the inevitable
demand for facts is sprung
on us. That is our bounden
duty, to make up our phrases beforehand,
so that we shall not be
caught unawares. It is not fair to
the children that we should give
them stupid floundering answers,
or snub them, or shut them up.
They have a perfect right to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
well thought out answer. That is
the meaning of what Horace says,
that the utmost reverence is due
to them. We cannot better reverence
them than by deciding, long
before the question comes, how
we will handle it. Think for a
moment what silly things are said
to children, all for want of careful
self-preparation.</p>

<p>To this good rule we might add
another—that we must never tell
them a lie. We ought not to be
liars, not even to small children.
Take, for instance, one of the best
of all opportunities for telling the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
truth; take the arrival of a baby
brother or sister. Where did it
come from? I have no patience
with people who say that the angels,
or the doctor, brought it. There
is enough nonsense already talked
about my profession without that.
What business have they to lie to
an honest child? Or take a more
heart-searching instance. Imagine
a child at Christmas-time playing
with that most beautiful of all
Christmas toys, a little <i>crêche</i>, with
little figures of Mary and Joseph
and the Babe lying in a manger;
and the child turns round and asks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
you where Baby Jesus came from.
What answer will you give? What
harm can it do to a child, to know
that children are born of their
mothers? What does harm the
minds of children is not our plain
speaking; it is their own secret
reading, gossiping, and imagining.</p>

<p>Now let me venture a bit further.
In the kingdom of a child’s mind,
it is not one set of thoughts, but
two, which gradually rise to power,
as the child grows to adult life.
Right away from the nursery age,
these two ideas are important
above all others; important alike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to the child and to us. One is the
child’s notions about sex; the other
is the child’s notions about God.
Everything else wavers and shifts;
we see the children change every
scrap of their minds over and over
again: their likes and their dislikes,
their plans and their decisions,
flourish and perish, and are no
more than stages or phases. But
these two purposes of their curiosity—the
desire to know what
sex is, and the desire to know
what God is—these endure, and
are more imperative with every
added year of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>As the children ask very absurd
questions about sex, so they ask
very absurd questions about God.
As we are taken aback, and say
foolish things to them over the one
subject, so we do over the other.
As we ought to prepare ourselves
for the one opportunity, so we
ought for the other. As we must
answer properly about sex, so we
must answer properly about God.
It is bad enough to shut them up
over sex; it is worse to shut them
up over God. They are trying to
get at something. They, at their
end of life, are like Sir John Falstaff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
at his end of life—you remember
the account of his death, by the
hostess of the Boar’s Head Tavern:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So ’a cried out—God, God, God!—three
or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid
him ’a should not think of God; I hoped
there was no need to trouble himself with
any such thoughts yet.</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever we say to the children
we must never say that. But who
will teach us what we ought to say?
Perhaps we might make a rule
that we will try not to play down
to their childish notions. On the
contrary, we will try to tell them
that our grown-up notions are
hardly less childish than theirs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
We cannot worship their little
graven image, but we can confess
to them that our own image is a
very poor thing. They will be glad
to hear of the feebleness of our
thoughts. We want to lead them
out of their first position: we want
to get them a little further on the
interminable quest. We shall not
do that by accepting and adopting
their idea of God, using it as an
argument or weapon against them.
But we may perhaps be of use to
them, if we explain to them that
we, even we, are nothing better
than babies, when it comes to attempting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to think of what we really
mean by the Divine Name. Let us
inform them plainly, that the best
that we can do for them is to conduct
them out of the poverty of
their minds into the poverty of ours.
It is possible, also, that we might
find it a good rule with children, to
make less use of the word “God,”
and more use of the word “the
Spirit,” or “the Holy Spirit.” This
word “Spirit” is not associated in
their minds with any bodily shape;
it may thus help them, as time goes
on, to forsake their little graven
image.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>I do believe that these two ideas—the
idea of sex, and the idea of
God—are of the utmost importance
to us in our dealings with children
and with adolescents. If we are
to think of constructing and reconstructing
human lives as if they
were houses, let us have the proper
materials for it, and let us handle
them wisely. These two ideas are
good materials; they will take any
amount of construction and of reconstruction,
and, if we build as we
ought, they will stand the very
heavy strain which will be put on
them. Please forgive me, that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
am treating my subject on these
old-fashioned lines; I did not choose
it: the authorities chose it for me.
They ought to have given it not to
a mere grandpapa, but to somebody
worthy of the unmusical name
of an educationalist.</p>

<p>In adolescence, in early adult
life, there comes a heavy strain on
these two ideas, and unless we
have built as we ought, some portion
of the edifice will be in danger
of falling. The point is, that we
must somehow manage to build
these two ideas together; we must
adjust and fit them together, giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to each of them its due place in
the house of life, not opposing but
conjoining them to each other, as
a builder conjoins bricks and mortar.
It is a true saying, “The reasonable
soul and flesh is one man.”
Please observe that they not <em>are</em>,
but <em>is</em>, one man; they are so closely
united that they <em>is</em> one man. It
follows, that what we call temptation
addresses itself not to the flesh
alone, but also to the reasonable
soul. Consider the predicament of
a young man who up to now has,
as we call it, “kept straight.” All
round him, day after day, newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
and books and shop windows
and theatres, and other men’s talk,
and the look of the crowd in the
streets, are alluding to it. His
pride is wounded, and the more
he tries not to think of it, the more
it hurts. All young men covet and
pursue the experiences of life; he
is vexed and resentful that he
should be thus incomplete. He
has given up what a young man
most hates to give up: he has given
up something which would make
him just like other young men.
Not only his body, but his reasonable
soul, is restless and impatient.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
That which impels him to the edge
of temptation is not his animal
nature but his whole human nature.</p>

<p>Other motives, alike in boys and
in girls, are vanity, sentimentality,
and intolerance, especially in these
tremendous days, of the monotonous
narrowness of their work and
the fretful discipline of their homes.
And there are some boys and girls—happily
it is a small minority—who
are so passionate and so
wilful that they hardly stop to
reckon what they are doing.</p>

<p>Of course, we have some antidotes
against temptation. One of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
them is the right employment of
mind and body; but the mind must
not be employed at haphazard, and
the body must not be over-fatigued.
The employment of the mind must
have a touch of refinement or fastidiousness:
things which are lurid
and vulgar must be recognised for
what they are: the boys and girls
must be fond of “good form”;
they must be picksome over books
and theatres and picture-palaces
and friendships. The employment
of the body must have a touch
of discipline or training: outdoor
exercise, athletics in moderation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
fresh air, plain food, cold water.
If I could be a little boy again, I
would join the Boy Scouts; if I
could be a young man again, I
would get on without alcohol and
cigarettes.</p>

<p>To these approved antidotes, let
me, as a doctor, add a good tonic,
to steady the nerves of adolescence.
I prescribe a full dose of
the natural sciences. Some people
believe in what are called “hobbies”
for boys and girls. I do
not think much of hobbies, if it
comes to nothing more than photographing
or stamp-collecting or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
carpentering at odd moments; but
I love to see boys and girls working
hard at physics and chemistry.
It is a grand thing for them:
it really does tranquillise and
strengthen them; I like to believe
that it even tends, as it were, to
reduce their high temperature and
their rapid pulse. All other employments
of the adolescent mind—as
Mrs. Tulliver, in <cite>The Mill on
the Floss</cite>, says of the crowns of
bonnets—they are “so chancy:
never two summers alike.” Books,
art, politics, amusements, outward
observances of religion—all of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
them are so chancy: all of them
are open to the criticism of the
young people. I remember, ages
ago, a German professor dining at
my father’s house; and in the
course of the talk some reference
was made to St. Paul. “Ah!
Paulus,” said the Professor, “I
have read his works; but I do not
agree with Paulus.” Science is not
like that: there is no chanciness in
her: we inevitably agree with her.
If a chemical test goes wrong, we
know that we have done it wrong.
This eternal certainty gives to
physics and chemistry, somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
authority over the vagrant minds
of boys and girls; and this
authority, surely, must help to
keep them able to resist temptation.</p>

<p>These antidotes and this tonic
are all very well; but the best thing
of all would be, for all boys and
girls, unfailing belief in what we
call the Spirit of God, or the
Presence of God, in their daily
affairs. I feel sure that there are
many of them who are more likely
to be kept straight by that than
by anything else.</p>

<p>And, of course, it is our business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
to prepare them, with all the wisdom
and forethought that we can
manage to find in ourselves, for
these dangerous years of early
adult life. But we must begin
while they are children; we must
begin with careful answers to their
ridiculous questions about sex and
about God. These two ideas are
our building-materials: we must
work them together, not keep
them apart, nor oppose them
to each other; we must go on,
constructing and reconstructing
them in the growing fabric of the
mind, adapting and adjusting them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
to each other: so that the children,
when they come to adolescence,
shall come to it neither
ignorant nor helpless.</p>

<p>So many of us hang about the
child’s mind, in a timid sort of
way, hesitating to go in. We look
up at the windows, we peep
through the letter-box, we try the
back door, we ring the bell very
gently—the left-hand bell, which
is marked Servants; we dare not
ring the visitors’ bell, nor ply the
knocker. And the child, all the
while, is expecting us. We wait
for opportunities. It is probable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
with some children, that we ought
to make them, not wait for them.
I do not altogether like the word
“initiate”; yet I have in my
imagination some special day set
and appointed for a grave little
home-ceremony; the whole thing
well thought out, the exhortation
written down beforehand, every
word of it. The occasion of telling
boys and girls the truth about their
bodily nature would thus be made
solemn and memorable, as an act
of their lives. I have been reading
again that scene in <cite>Tom Brown’s
Schooldays</cite>, where the Squire gives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
his parting advice to Tom, on the
way to Rugby. It is one of the
hundred best things in one of the
hundred best books. Only, all
boys and girls are not alike: there
is need, with some of them, of
saying more than the Squire said.
Perhaps a birthday would afford a
good opportunity. And, of course,
it ought to be done at home: it
ought to be done by the child’s
parents. Most of us here, when
we were 14 or 15 years old, were
confirmed, and received the Holy
Communion. It was a little time
of quiet self-judgment and good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
resolutions; it really did help us.
If I could have my life back, I
should like to be told about my
bodily nature in that devout and
premeditated way. It ought to be
done at home, and my father
ought to do it, probably on my
birthday. Instead of that, it was
done by another boy, at a preparatory
school. I still remember
the exact words that we used, and
I could still find almost the very
paving-stone on which I was
standing.</p>

<p>There are things to be said to
children; and there are things to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
be said to older boys and girls
going out into the world. I cannot
fix the right ages for it: no two
children are alike. I feel, also, that
first-rate school teachers are more
likely than second-rate parents to
say the right thing to children.
There is a place, doubtless, in
school teaching, for lessons in
botany and in natural history. The
trouble is, that some of the children
may fail to see what you
are driving at. You can lead
them to the very edge of the
stream of analogy, but you cannot
make them drink. They may remain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
at the last moment, recalcitrant;
and you may never get
quite so far as to tell them what
you were intending to tell them.</p>

<p>If it were my duty to inform a
boy, between 12 and 14 years old—and
it certainly is not the business
of any man to speak to girls about
their bodily nature—I would not
begin with botany. I would begin
with mankind. I would tell him
that all of us come out of the
bodies of our mothers: and in
that way come all creatures. I
would argue from us to animals,
not from animals to us. Then I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
would say something about the
anatomical differences between
male and female children: and I
would tell him that this difference
runs through all creation, all the
distance from us down to plants
and flowers. And I would say to
him, “All creatures are formed in
this way, in the bodies of their
mothers, before they are born: but
they cannot begin to be formed,
till the male and the female have
actually come together: and that is
all that you need to know.” If it
were my duty to talk to a young
man 18 or 19 years old, I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
talk to him as to any other man,
freely and explicitly; I would also
warn him of the disastrous bodily
results which may follow even one
act of wrong-doing, and how these
results might be visited, years
hence, on his children. And, of
course, whatever the age, I would
not only lecture, I would also
preach. If I am to help a boy to
“keep straight,” I must appeal
from that which is natural in him
to that which is spiritual in him.</p>

<p>And—so far as adolescence is
concerned—if ever there was a
time when we ought to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
plainly, it is now. Whether we
like it or not, the old habit of
silence has for some years been
falling away from us. Even before
the War, we had begun to talk
more freely, and to be less offended
by plain speaking. The War has
made it still harder for us to remain
silent. We have seen, everywhere,
boys and girls, all of a sudden,
as it were transfigured: the boys
turned into men, the girls turned
into women; courage, obedience,
endurance, flaming up in them, so
that we marvel at them. But we
have seen, also, the dark side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
their life. They have gone ahead
so fast, and their eyes are so
dazzled, that some of them will
not stop to read our danger-signals.
Most of us have some influence
over them, some of us have great
influence. Things already are bad
enough, and, in all probability, will
be worse in the near future. Our
influence was not given to us for
nothing: and if we do not exercise
it now, we shall be sorry, too
late.</p>

<p>There is one more bit of advice,
in these days, which we might
give to young men. The War<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
seems to make it somehow wrong,
that a young man, of decent character,
in good health and steady
work, should remain unmarried.
He ought to marry, that sons of
his may serve their country, filling
the empty places of the young
men who have died for their
country. Before the War, it was
nobody’s business but his own,
whether a young man were
married or single. We observe
him now from another point of
view, with every added month of
the War, and every casualty-list;
we say that he is not doing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
duty, if he prefers the comfort and
the freedom of bachelor-life to the
cares of marriage and parentage.
Let him so live now, in these
terrible days, that his children
shall be born healthy, a blessing
alike to him and to his country.</p>

<p>Now, to finish with, let me dot
the <em>i</em>’s and cross the <em>t</em>’s of this
paper. It is likely enough that
I have been talking more of things
as they were in my boyhood than
of things as they are now. The
Victorian Age was in many ways
magnificent; but it neither approved
of inquisitive children, nor enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
them. For example—one
of my contemporaries tells me
that she was taught botany out of a
book called <cite>Lindley’s Ladies’ Botany</cite>.
In this book, the fact that flowers
are male and female was carefully
left out. She learned this fact
when she was 18; she gathered it
from a sermon in church, and it
vexed and offended her. We have
got past all that sort of nonsense.
But we are still at sixes and sevens
how to tell children about their
bodily nature. We let them alone,
they let us alone; we wait, they
wait; neither we nor they like to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
begin. We do not know what they
are thinking of. But we know this
much, that there are two sets of
thoughts which must, simply must,
be growing up together in their
minds—the idea of sex, and the
idea of God. We cannot help
them without self-preparation; we
muddle them, not educate them, on
these two subjects, unless we have
made up our own minds how we
will answer their questions.</p>

<p>Further, I do believe that some
parents might well make a solemn
little home-ceremony of telling a
child about his or her bodily nature;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
not leave it to chance, nor to the
unclean talk of schoolfellows; no,
nor even leave it to the child’s
teachers. Father or mother ought
to do it. And, when the children
are grown up, it ought to be done
again, with clear warning against
the dangers which they are going
into.</p>

<p>Finally, what they need is not
physiology alone, but physiology and
faith together. There has been a
great deal too much science talked
about adolescence. Too much
physiology, pathology, psychology—not
that psychology really is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
science—too much analysis, too
many statistics. If any of you, as
parents or as teachers, do require a
short science-book, there is Dr.
Starr’s <cite>The Adolescent Period</cite>. It
has its faults. It is unduly apprehensive
of some things which are
not important. It makes too much
of those boys and girls who are
abnormal. Some children are abnormal;
and some, but very few,
are as it were demoniac, to their
own misery and the misery of
others. These most unhappy children
have been put under the
microscope for us by our kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
friends the psychologists. But the
vast majority of boys and girls are
normal.</p>

<p>Dr. Starr’s book is not for
general reading. Still, for the
right sort of readers, it is a good
and useful book. But what, after
all, do we want with books? It is
the children that we have got to
read; not books about them, but
them. I doubt whether psychologists
understand ordinary children
better than a wise old family nurse
understands them. Boys and girls
are human beings: they were not
discovered by science: they refuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
to be elucidated by science. The
way for us to help them is not by
psychology, but by faith, self-preparation,
courage, and common
sense.</p>
